# mikenye/tar1090

[`tar1090`](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) is an excellent tool by [wiedehopf](https://github.com/wiedehopf) that provides an improved [`dump1090-fa`](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) interface.

At the time of writing this README, it provides:

* Improved adjustable history
* Show All Tracks much faster than original with many planes
* Multiple Maps available
* Map can be dimmed/darkened
* Multiple aircraft can be selected
* Labels with the callsign can be switched on and off
* Heatmap of aircraft positions

This image:

* Receives Beast data from a provider such as `dump1090` or `readsb`
* Optionally, receives MLAT data from a provider such as `mlat-client`
* Provides the `tar1090` web interface
* Provides the `timelapse1090` web interface

It builds and runs on `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7` and `linux/arm64` (see below).

## Note for Users running 32-bit Debian Buster-based OSes on ARM

Please see: [Buster-Docker-Fixes](https://github.com/fredclausen/Buster-Docker-Fixes)!

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` should always contain the latest released versions of `readsb`, `tar1090` and `tar1090-db`. This image is built nightly from the `master` branch `Dockerfile` for all supported architectures.
* `latest_nohealthcheck` is the same as the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Specific version tags are available if required, however these are not regularly updated. It is generally recommended to run latest.

## Multi Architecture Support

* `linux/amd64`: Built on Linux x86-64
* `linux/arm/v6`: Built on Odroid HC2 running ARMv7 32-bit
* `linux/arm/v7`: Built on Odroid HC2 running ARMv7 32-bit
* `linux/arm64`: Built on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B running ARMv8 64-bit

## Prerequisites

You will need a source of Beast data. This could be an RPi running PiAware, the [`mikenye/piaware`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/piaware) image or [`mikenye/readsb-protobuf`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/readsb-protobuf).

Optionally, you will need a source of MLAT data. This could be:

* [`mikenye/adsbexchange`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/adsbexchange) image
* [`mikenye/piaware`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/piaware) image
* Basically anything running `mlat-client` listening for beast connections (ie: `--results beast,listen,30105`)

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=tar1090 \
    -p 8078:80 \
    -e TZ=<TIMEZONE> \
    -e BEASTHOST=<BEASTHOST> \
    -e MLATHOST=<MLATHOST> \
    -e LAT=xx.xxxxx \
    -e LONG=xx.xxxxx \
    --tmpfs=/run:exec,size=64M \
    --tmpfs=/var/log \
    mikenye/tar1090:latest
```

Replacing `TIMEZONE` with your timezone, `BEASTHOST` with the IP address of a host that can provide Beast data, and `MLATHOST` with the IP address of a host that can provide MLAT data.

For example:

```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=tar1090 \
    -p 8078:80 \
    -e TZ=Australia/Perth \
    -e BEASTHOST=readsb \
    -e MLATHOST=adsbx \
    -e LAT=-33.33333 \
    -e LONG=111.11111 \
    --tmpfs=/run:exec,size=64M \
    --tmpfs=/var/log \
    mikenye/tar1090:latest
```

You should now be able to browse to:

* <http://dockerhost:8078/> to access the tar1090 web interface
* <http://dockerhost:8078/?heatmap> to see the heatmap for the past 24 hours.
* <http://dockerhost:8078/?heatmap&realHeat> to see a different heatmap for the past 24 hours.

## Up-and-Running with `docker-compose`

An example `docker-compose.xml` file is below:

```shell
version: '2.0'

networks:
  adsbnet:

services:

  tar1090:
    image: mikenye/tar1090:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: tar1090
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=Australia/Perth
      - BEASTHOST=readsb
      - MLATHOST=adsbx
      - LAT=-33.33333
      - LONG=111.11111
    networks:
      - adsbnet
    ports:
      - 8078:80
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log

```

You should now be able to browse to:

* <http://dockerhost:8078/> to access the tar1090 web interface.
* <http://dockerhost:8078/?heatmap> to see the heatmap for the past 24 hours.
* <http://dockerhost:8078/?heatmap&realHeat> to see a different heatmap for the past 24 hours.

*Note*: the example above excludes `MLATHOST` as `readsb` alone cannot provide MLAT data. You'll need a feeder container for this.

## Ports

### Outgoing

This container will try to connect to the `BEASTHOST` on TCP port `30005` by default. This can be changed by setting the `BEASTPORT` environment variable.

If `MLATHOST` is set, this container will try to connecto the `MLATHOST` on TCP port `30105` by default. This can be changed to setting the `MLATPORT` environment variable.

### Incoming

This container accepts HTTP connections on TCP port `80` by default. You can change this with the container's port mapping. In the examples above, this has been changed to `8078`.
